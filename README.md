A fun, interactive Dice Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I learned the basics of this project from Angela Yu’s Web Development course on Udemy and added my own custom features:

🎉 Pop-up notifications for milestones
📊 Scoreboard to track wins, losses, and draws
▶️ Play button to make the game fully playable
💻 Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Enjoy rolling the dice and trying to beat the computer!
